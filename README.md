# Presentation Slides Repository
This repository is a collection of presentation slides that I have created for various competitions and presentations. It serves as a central location to store and organize these slides for future reference.

## Structure
The repository is organized into subdirectories for each event or presentation. Within each subdirectory, there are additional subdirectories for each version or iteration of the presentation slides.

## Usage
Feel free to use these slides as a reference or inspiration for your own presentations. If you would like to use any of the slides directly, please contact me for permission.

## Contributing
If you have presentation slides that you would like to add to this repository, feel free to create a pull request. Please ensure that your slides are organized in a similar manner to the existing structure and include a brief description in the README file.

## Contact
If you have any questions or comments about this repository, please feel free to contact me via email or social media.
